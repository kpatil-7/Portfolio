# Chatbot

Welcome to the Chatbot repository! This is a simple chatbot built using artificial intelligence to engage in conversations with users.

## Functionality

The chatbot is designed to understand and respond to various user intents. It currently supports the following intents:

- `greeting`: Handles greetings from the user.
- `good bye`: Responds to the user when they want to end the conversation.
- `help`: Provides assistance to the user.
- `thanks`: Responds to expressions of gratitude.
- `weather`: Provides information about the weather.
- `restaurant_search`: Helps the user find restaurants near their location.
- `music_recommendation`: Recommends music based on user preferences.
- `book_recommendation`: Suggests books for the user to read.
- `loneliness`: Responds to the user's feelings of loneliness.
- `despair`: Provides support to the user during moments of despair.
- `regret`: Offers guidance and perspective on feelings of regret.
- `fear`: Provides encouragement to the user when they are feeling scared.
- `heartbreak`: Responds empathetically to the user's heartbreak.
- `betrayal`: Offers insights on coping with feelings of betrayal.

## Usage

To use the chatbot, you can integrate it into your own application or platform by making API calls to the chatbot service. The API should accept user messages and respond with the appropriate chatbot response based on the detected intent.

Here's an example API request:

```http
POST /chatbot/message
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "Hello!",
  "context": ""
}
```

And the corresponding response:

```json
{
  "message": "is this what it feels like to be human?"
}
```

You can iterate through the conversation by sending subsequent API requests, providing the user's messages and updating the context as needed.

## Further Customization

The chatbot responses provided in this repository are generated using artificial intelligence models. To improve and customize the responses, you can modify the intents, patterns, and responses in the `intents.json` file. Additionally, you can train the chatbot with more data to make it more accurate and context-aware.

Feel free to experiment and adapt the chatbot to suit your specific requirements and use cases.
