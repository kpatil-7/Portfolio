# Welcome to My Power BI Dashboards Repository
This repository serves as a central hub for my collection of Power BI dashboards. Here, you will find a variety of interactive visualizations and data analyses on different topics. As I continue to develop new dashboards, I will update this README to provide an overview of the available dashboards and their respective features.

### 2. Amazon Purchases  
I recently went through a major move, not just to a different city, but to a whole new country. As a result, I found myself needing to shop for almost everything, from essential items like a mattress and shower caddy to those late-night snacks. Since I had been focused on my master's degree, spending most of my time at school, I opted to order most of these items online and have them delivered to my new place. With the convenience of Amazon Prime, the process became much easier.

However, when the end of the month arrived and I sat down to review my financial statements, I was taken aback. Did I really order that much stuff? It seemed hard to believe. To gain a better understanding of my spending habits, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I took the initiative to scrape and extract my own data, and then visualize it to see which categories accounted for the majority of my expenses and their corresponding percentages.

####       Purpose of This Project
The purpose of this GitHub repository is to showcase the data scraping and visualization project I embarked upon to gain insights into my own spending patterns. By examining the data, I aimed to identify which categories I frequented the most and determine the percentage of my expenses allocated to each category. The project involved utilizing various tools and techniques, including data scraping, data analysis, and data visualization. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into my spending habits and discovered opportunities for more informed financial decision-making.
