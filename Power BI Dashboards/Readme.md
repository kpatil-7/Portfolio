# Welcome to My Power BI Dashboards Repository
This repository serves as a central hub for my collection of Power BI dashboards. Here, you will find a variety of interactive visualizations and data analyses on different topics. As I continue to develop new dashboards, I will update this README to provide an overview of the available dashboards and their respective features.

## Available Dashboards
### 1. Dog Breeds for Adoption
#### About the Dashboard
Welcome to the Popular Dog Breeds for Adoption dashboard, where you can explore a diverse collection of dogs eagerly waiting to find their forever homes. This interactive dashboard provides valuable insights into various aspects of these adorable canines, including the male-female ratio, age distribution, breed characteristics, and compatibility with children and other pets, such as cats. With engaging visuals and comprehensive information, this dashboard aims to help you make informed decisions and discover the perfect furry companion that aligns with your preferences and lifestyle.

##### Understanding the Journey of Dog Adoption
During my younger years, I naively believed that dogs could be obtained like any other item from a store. I thought you could simply pick the one you wanted, place it in your cart, and take it home, just like buying cereal. However, as I grew older and started volunteering at an animal rescue, I quickly realized that the process of adopting a dog was far more profound. It wasn't about me choosing a puppy; it was about the puppy choosing me.
Through my volunteer work at Paws Animal Rescue, I had the opportunity to care for dogs, take them on walks, play with them, and shower them with love. It was during this time that I developed a deeper understanding and appreciation for different breeds. I recall being hesitant around Pit Bulls due to their negative portrayal in the media. However, after walking a few of them, I discovered that they were absolute sweethearts, just like any other dog. This experience shifted my perspective and inspired me to gather information about dogs available for adoption, seeking to learn more about each breed.

#### Shedding Light on Unadopted Breeds
Unfortunately, not all dogs find their forever homes as quickly as we would hope. Heartbreakingly, Pit Bulls are one of the most commonly unadopted breeds. Misconceptions and unfair stereotypes often hinder their chances of finding loving families. By shedding light on this issue and providing insights into the availability of different breeds, this dashboard aims to raise awareness and encourage potential adopters to consider all breeds, giving each dog a chance at a happy and fulfilling life.

### 2. Amazon Purchases  
I recently went through a major move, not just to a different city, but to a whole new country. As a result, I found myself needing to shop for almost everything, from essential items like a mattress and shower caddy to those late-night snacks. Since I had been focused on my master's degree, spending most of my time at school, I opted to order most of these items online and have them delivered to my new place. With the convenience of Amazon Prime, the process became much easier.

However, when the end of the month arrived and I sat down to review my financial statements, I was taken aback. Did I really order that much stuff? It seemed hard to believe. To gain a better understanding of my spending habits, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I took the initiative to scrape and extract my own data, and then visualize it to see which categories accounted for the majority of my expenses and their corresponding percentages.

#### Purpose of This Project
The purpose of this GitHub repository is to showcase the data scraping and visualization project I embarked upon to gain insights into my own spending patterns. By examining the data, I aimed to identify which categories I frequented the most and determine the percentage of my expenses allocated to each category. The project involved utilizing various tools and techniques, including data scraping, data analysis, and data visualization. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into my spending habits and discovered opportunities for more informed financial decision-making.
