# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Random Forest Regression

This repository contains code for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and building a Random Forest Regression model on a given dataset. The dataset consists of information related to restaurant bills and tips.

## Dataset

The dataset (`your_dataset.csv`) includes the following columns:

- `total_bill`: Total bill amount in dollars
- `tip`: Tip amount in dollars
- `sex`: Gender of the customer (Male/Female)
- `smoker`: Smoking status of the customer (Yes/No)
- `day`: Day of the week (Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat)
- `time`: Time of the day (Lunch/Dinner)
- `size`: Number of people in the dining party

## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

The code in `EDA.py` performs EDA on the dataset using various visualization techniques. The following operations are conducted:

- Displaying the first few rows of the dataset
- Summary statistics of numerical columns
- Checking for missing values
- Visualizing the distribution of the target variable (tip) using a histogram
- Visualizing the relationship between numerical features and the target variable using a pair plot
- Visualizing the relationship between categorical features and the target variable using box plots

## Random Forest Regression

The code in `main.py` demonstrates how to build a Random Forest Regression model using the dataset. The following steps are executed:

- Loading the dataset
- Extracting input features and the target variable
- Converting categorical variables into dummy/indicator variables
- Splitting the dataset into train and test sets
- Creating a Random Forest Regressor
- Training the model on the training set
- Making predictions on the test set
- Evaluating the model performance using mean squared error

## Instructions

1. Make sure you have Python and the required dependencies installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Place the dataset (`your_dataset.csv`) in the same directory.
4. Run `EDA.py` to perform exploratory data analysis and visualize the dataset.
5. Run `main.py` to build and evaluate the Random Forest Regression model.

Feel free to modify the code and dataset according to your needs.

Happy exploring and modeling!
